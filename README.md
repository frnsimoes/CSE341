This course is a series of lectures by Dan Grossman - University of Washington. Who is Dan Grossman and why is this important, you ask? Simple. I didn't know who Dan Grossman was too. But then I visited his personal web page and found this:

He knows who Leibniz and Malebranche are. Do you need reasons other than these?

Ok. One more reason: Grossman soon realized he was not motivated by expensive suits and fixed working hours: 

> At one point over the summer, Grossman and friends went to Chuy’s, a local Tex-Mex restaurant for dinner. “We arrived without realizing there was a major happy hour event going on, and had to wait for a table for about 45 minutes,” said Grossman. While talking with his friends, Grossman kept observing the happy hour crowd and began to compare it to his previous expectations of finishing a bachelor’s degree, getting a job, and buying a house in the suburbs.

> “As I watched all those professionals in their mid-20s, standing around in their work clothes and chit-chatting over drinks, I realized how much I did not want to be there in four years. I wondered if there was another path for me,” said Grossman.
