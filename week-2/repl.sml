(* Read-Eval_print_Loop
*
* Can just treat it as a strange or convenient way to run programs. 
* - But more conveniente for quick try-something-out
* - Then move things over to a testing file for easy reuse.
*
* Errors: 
* - Syntax: 
*   What you wrote means nothing or not the cronstruct you inteded.
* - Type-checking:
*   What you wrote does not type-check.
* - Evaluation:
